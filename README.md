# Minotaur
Firstly the latest version online [Minotaur](https://vlasovalexey.github.io/Minotaur/HTML_SRC/)

Minotaur is a Java and HTML5 a hardware and software system. It allows for measurement of tensioned lines, which are often used as reference – for example, for cave diving survey, or archeological survey.
For remote underwater caves exploration, speed of survey is essential. Using traditional slates and compass is a very time consuming method. Necessity to lay straight lines, and avoid placements sometimes force to spend a lot of time for laying exploration line.

With The Minotaur, all needed is to simply dive through the cave, gently pushing the device on the line. Due to constant measurement mode, survey is made regardless of placements or complicated line positioning.
This survey is a very fast and precise measurement method, it will be difficult to use in tight environments, restricted caves. For the the highest accuracy level a permanent reference grid measurement is always the best option.
